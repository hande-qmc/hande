module excit_gen_op_mol

! Module for random excitation generators and related routines for operators
! other than the Hamiltonian for generic systems, where the integrals are read
! in (i.e. molecular systems).

! See excit_gen_mol for more information about standard excitation generators.

! excitation generators.

! This is a hack until the excitation generators support generating excitations
! for operators of arbitrary symmetries.
