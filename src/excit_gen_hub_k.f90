!--- Split excitation gnerators ---

! Because the off-diagonal matrix elements are so simple in the Hubbard model,
! we don't actually need to generate the entire excitation before we have
! sufficient information to test whether the spawning event is accepted.  This
! allows us to save some time when the spawning attempt is rejected (which is
! the majority of the time).

! These split excitation generators *MUST BE USED IN PAIRS*.

! gen_excit_init_hub_k*:     provides sufficient information to attempt spawning
!                            event.
! gen_excit_finalise_hub_k*: provides rest of excitation required to determine
!                            the sign of the child walkers.

            ! Consider the excitation (i,j) -> (a,b).

            ! As such, we cannot generate an excitation where the alpha orbital
            ! in the virtal pair (a,b) is already occupied (even though the beta
