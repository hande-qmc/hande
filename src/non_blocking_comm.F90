! Core routines for initialisation and termination for non-blocking
! communication QMC algorithm.

! Non-Blocking Communications
! ===========================
!
! The cost of MPI communication soon becomes the biggest overhead when scaling a
! code to thousands of cores. Non-blocking communications (NBCs) can potentially
! reduce or eliminate this overhead if the communication operation is overlapped
! with computation. NBCs have been shown to help both strong (scaling the same
! problem size to more processors) and weak (increasing the problem size in
! proportion to the increase in processor count) scaling in the QMC code CASINO.
! Implementing them for FCIQMC is slightly tricky, as while annihilation is not
! necessary at every time step (see continuous time algorithm), it is vital that
! psips are annihilated at the same point in time.
!
! The general outline of the algorithm is the following:
!
! 1. Evolve the main list to time t + dt.
! 2. Receive walkers spawned during the previous iteration's evolution of the
!    main list into a second spawn_t type object (received_list).
! 3. We now need to evolve this received list one time step so that they can be
!    annihilated with the main list (evolve_spawned_walkers).
! 4. Annihilation then proceeds by annihilating the entirety of the received_list
!    and the portion of the spawned list which contains all walkers spawned from the
!    current processor onto the current processor in this iteration. This
!    includes walkers spawned from the received_list and the main list.
! 5. We then perform a non-blocking send operation of the walkers in the spawned
!    list to their new processors which will be received and evolved as in step
!    2 above.
!
! Starting NB calculation requires us to initially send / receive zero walkers
! so that step 2 above can be carried out without a special case in the first
! iteration.
!
! The staggered nature of events complicates certain things such as restarting
! a calculation and the reporting of report loop quantities.
! To avoid blocking mpi calls in between non-blocking sends/receives (which
! would happen during a report loop), we also use NBCs. This means
! that we print out the nth report loop's information when we usually would have
! printed the (n+1)st. It also means that the shift we use when evolving from
! step t to t + mc_steps*dt is based on total populations from the previous
! report loop.
! These above features also complicate the restarting of a calculation, as the
! shift required for the first iteration is not what would normally be printed
! out in the restart file. Currently only calculations restarted from
! one which used NBCs behave correctly as the shift is generally
! incorrect otherwise.
!
! Currently point-to-point nbcs are used as collective nbcs have only
! recently been added to the MPI standard (3.0) and which is not widely
! implemented by vendors.
