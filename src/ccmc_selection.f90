        ! Select a random cluster of excitors from the excitors on the
        ! processor.  A cluster of excitors is itself an excitor.  For clarity
        ! (if not technical accuracy) in comments we shall distinguish between
        ! the cluster of excitors and a single excitor, from a set of which the
        ! cluster is formed.

        ! In:
        !    sys: system being studied
        !    psip_list: particle_t object containing current excip distribution on
        !       this processor.
        !    f0: bit string of the reference.
        !    ex_level: max number of excitations from the reference to include in
        !        the Hilbert space.
        !    nattempts: the number of times (on this processor) a random cluster
        !        of excitors is generated in the current timestep.
        !    linked_ccmc: if true then only sample linked clusters.
        !    normalisation: intermediate normalisation factor, N_0, where we use the
        !       wavefunction ansatz |\Psi_{CC}> = N_0 e^{T/N_0} | D_0 >.
        !    initiator_pop: the population above which a determinant is an initiator.
        !    D0_pos: position in the excip list of the reference.  Must be negative
        !       if the reference is not on the processor.
        !    cumulative_excip_population: running cumulative excip population on
        !        all excitors; i.e. cumulative_excip_population(i) = sum(particle_t%pops(1:i)).
        !    tot_excip_pop: total excip population.
        !    min_size: the minimum size cluster to allow.
        !    max_size: the maximum size cluster to allow.

        ! NOTE: cumulative_excip_pop and tot_excip_pop ignore the population on the
        ! reference as excips on the reference cannot form a cluster and the rounds the
        ! population on all other excitors to the nearest integer (for convenience--see
        ! comments in do_ccmc).  Both these quantities should be generated by
        ! cumulative_population (or be in the same format).

        ! In/Out:
        !    rng: random number generator.
        !    cdet: information about the cluster of excitors applied to the
        !        reference determinant.  This is a bare det_info_t variable on input
        !        with only the relevant fields allocated.  On output the
        !        appropriate (system-specific) fields have been filled by
        !        decoding the bit string of the determinant formed from applying
        !        the cluster to the reference determinant.
        !    cluster:
        !        Additional information about the cluster of excitors.  On
        !        input this is a bare cluster_t variable with the excitors array
        !        allocated to the maximum number of excitors in a cluster.  On
        !        output all fields in cluster have been set.

        !   p_clust is the probability of choosing a specific cluster given
        !           the choice of size.

        ! Each processor does nattempts.
        ! However:
        ! * if min_size=0, then each processor is allowed to select the reference (on
        !   average) nattempts/2 times.  Hence in order to have selection probabilities
        !   consistent and independent of the number of processors being used (which
        !   amounts to a processor-dependent timestep scaling), we need to multiply the
        !   probability the reference is selected by nprocs.
        ! * assuming each excitor spends (on average) the same amount of time on each
        !   processor, the probability that X different excitors are on the same processor
        !   at a given timestep is 1/nprocs^{X-1).
        ! The easiest way to handle both of these is to multiply the number of attempts by
        ! the number of processors here and then deal with additional factors of 1/nprocs
        ! when creating composite clusters.
        ! NB within a processor those nattempts can be split amongst OpenMP
        ! threads though that doesn't affect this probability.

        ! Following the process described by Thom in 'Initiator Stochastic

        ! This procedure is modified so that clusters of size min_size+n_s
        ! has probability 1/2^(n_s+1), and the max_size picks up the remaining
        ! probability from the series.
