        ! Attempt to spawn a new particle on a connected excitor with
        ! probability
        !     \tau |<D'|H|D_s> A_s|
        !   -------------------------
        !   n_sel p_s p_clust p_excit
        ! where |D_s> is the determinant formed by applying the excitor to the
        ! reference determinant, A_s is the amplitude and D' is the determinant
        ! formed from applying a connected excitor to the reference determinant.
        ! See comments in select_cluster about n_sel, p_s and p_clust.  p_excit
        ! is the probability of choosing D' given D_s.

        ! This is just a thin wrapper around a system-specific excitation
        ! generator and a utility function.  We need to modify the spawning
        ! probability compared to the FCIQMC algorithm as we spawn from multiple
        ! excips at once (in FCIQMC we allow each psip to spawn individually)
        ! and have additional probabilities to take into account.

        ! This routine will only attempt one spawning event, but needs to know
        ! the total number attempted for this cluster which is passed into
        ! nspawnings_total.

        ! In linked CCMC, the probability of spawning is modified by changing
        ! the matrix elements <D'|H|D_s> so that only linked diagrams are used
        ! for spawning.

        ! In:
        !    sys: system being studied.
        !    qs: qmc_state_t object. The timestep and reference determinant are used.
        !    spawn_cutoff: The size of the minimum spawning event allowed, in
        !        the encoded representation. Events smaller than this will be
        !        stochastically rounded up to this value or down to zero.
        !    linked_ccmc: if true then only sample linked clusters.
        !    cdet: info on the current excitor (cdet) that we will spawn
        !        from.
        !    cluster: information about the cluster which forms the excitor.  In
        !        particular, we use the amplitude, cluster_to_det_sign and pselect
        !        (i.e. n_sel.p_s.p_clust) attributes in addition to any used in
        !        the excitation generator.
        !    gen_excit_ptr: procedure pointer to excitation generators.
        !        gen_excit_ptr%full *must* be set to a procedure which generates
        !        a complete excitation.
        !    logging_info: logging_t derived type containing information on logging behaviour.
        ! In/Out:
        !    rng: random number generator.
        !    nspawnings_total: The total number of spawnings attemped by the current cluster
        !        in the current timestep.
        ! Out:
        !    nspawn: number of particles spawned, in the encoded representation.
        !        0 indicates the spawning attempt was unsuccessful.
        !    connection: excitation connection between the current excitor
        !        and the child excitor, on which progeny are spawned.
