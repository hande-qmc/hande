! Holder for mapping the hash of a state to a processor.
type proc_map_t
    ! Number of slots (initially) assigned to each processor.
    integer :: nslots
    ! Array which maps particles to processors. If attempting load balancing
    ! then proc_map is initially subdivided into load_balancing_slots number of
    ! slots which cyclically map particles to processors using modular
    ! arithmetic. Otherwise it's entries are
    ! 0,1,..,nprocs-1.
    ! map(modulo(hash(state),nslots*nprocs)) gives the processor to which the
    ! state is assigned.
    integer, allocatable :: map(:) ! nslots*nprocs
end type proc_map_t

! Holder for spawned objects.
! Each object consists of a single entry, containing:
! * bit string identifying location of the spawned particle(s).
! * population (number) of spawned particles in one or more 'spaces' (e.g. real
!   and imaginary, sampling different operators, etc).
! * an optional flag containing various additional information (e.g. if it was
!   produced by an initiator in iFCIQMC).
! By combining the sets of info into one array, we can reduce the number of MPI
! communication calls during annihilation.
type spawn_t
    ! Maximum number of spawned objects.
    integer :: array_len
    ! Number of integers which make up the identifying bit string (ie some kind
    ! of location of the particle).
    integer :: bit_str_len
    ! Total number of bits in the bit string used to represent the label.
    ! This allows us to assign a processor based upon hashing a given number of bits and
    ! hence make the processor assignment independent of the size of the integer used in
    ! the bit string (which naturally includes some padding if bit_str_nbits is not
    ! a multiple of i0_length).
    integer :: bit_str_nbits
    ! Number of types of of different particles which are spawned at the same
    ! time.
    integer :: ntypes
    ! sdata(flag_indx,i) is the element containing flags (ie additional info)
    ! for the i-th element.
    integer :: flag_indx
    ! Total number of elements in each spawned object/element (ie len(sdata(:,1))).
    integer :: element_len
    ! The minimum allowed population of a spawning event. Any events with
    ! with populations below this threshold should be stochastically rounded
    ! up to it or down to zero.
    ! During creation of a spawn_t instance, cutoff is multiplied by
    ! real_factor = 2^(real_bit_shift) and rounded up to nearest integer, and
    ! then stored in this format.
    integer(int_p) :: cutoff

    ! sdata holds the spawned particles and associated information.
    ! The structure of sdata is:
    !   sdata(1:bit_str_len,i)
    !       the bit string of the location (ie determinant) of the i-th spawned particle(s).
    !   sdata(bit_str_len+j,i), 1<=j<=ntypes
    !       population of a particle of type j on the location above.
    !   sdata(flag_indx,i)
    !       any flags (by setting bits) associated with the spawned particles.
    ! element_len = bit_str_len + ntypes + 1.

    ! With MPI parallelisation, a particle on one processor can create a spawned
    ! particle on any other processor.  To make communication simple, we assign
    ! the first block_size entries to particles being sent to processor 0, the next
    ! block_size entries to those being sent to processor 1 and so on.

    ! OpenMP parallelisation complicates matters slightly as we wish to avoid
    ! critical/atomic blocks when spawning.  sdata is therefore an *interleaved* array.
    ! If sdata(:,i) is created by thread 0, then sdata(:,i+1) is created by thread 1,
    ! sdata(:,i+2) by thread 2, ..., sdata(:,i+nthreads-1) by thread nthreads-1 and
    ! sdata(:,i+nthreads) by thread 0 again.  The location to use in sdata is controlled
    ! by head.

    ! NOTE: the above assumes that each thread will produce a roughly equal number of
    ! spawned particles and each processor will be sent a roughly equal number
    ! of spawned particles from a given processor.

    ! Note sdata is not actually allocated but actually points to an internal store (store1 or
    ! store2) for efficient communication and simpler code.
    integer(int_s), pointer :: sdata(:,:) ! (element_len,array_len)

    ! block_size is the size of each block of sdata (in terms of the outer-most index)
    ! which is associated with a single processor.
    integer :: block_size
    ! head(j,i) gives the position in sdata of the last spawned particle created
    ! by thread j to be sent to processor i.  The meaning of head is changed by
    ! the compression and communication routines (see below).  head must be set
    ! to head_start at the start of each set of spawning events.
    integer, allocatable :: head(:,:)  ! (0:nthreads-1,0:nprocs-1)
    ! head_start(j,i)+nthreads gives the position in sdata of the first spawned
    ! particle created by thread j to be sent to processor i.
    ! (Note:
    !       1) the first thing the particle creation routines do is add nthread to
    !          the appropriate element of head to find the next empty slot to spawn
    !          into.
    !       2) head_start(nthreads-1,i) gives the index before the first element of
    !          a particle to be sent to processor i.
    ! )
    integer, allocatable :: head_start(:,:) ! (0:nthreads-1,0:nprocs-1)
    ! seed for hash routine used to determine which processor a given bit string
    ! should be sent to.
    integer(c_int) :: hash_seed
    ! if non-zero, then hash_shift is mixed with a hash of the bit string and
    ! then rehashed to obtain the process to which a bit string is assigned.
    ! See assign_particle_processor.
    integer :: hash_shift = 0
    ! if hash_shift is non-zero, then the processor a bit string is assigned to
    ! will change once in every 2^move_freq blocks of values for hash_shift.
