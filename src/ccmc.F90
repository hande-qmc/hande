module ccmc

! Module  for performing coupled cluster Monte Carlo (CCMC) calculations).

! Due to the similarities with FCIQMC, we can re-use lots of the same routines
! (especially the spawning, death and annihilation).  As a result, the structure
! of do_ccmc is remarkably similar to the other do_*mc routines.

! NOTE:
!     FCIQMC routines work entirely in a determinant framework.  This is
!     somewhat inconsistent with coupled cluster which is most naturally defined
!     in terms of excitors.  Thus when considering the interface between CC
!     routines and FCI routines, one should mentally translate 'Slater
!     determinant' into 'the Slater determinant formed by applying the excitor
!     to the reference determinant'.

! Numerous discussions with Alex Thom (AJWT) and access to drafts/preprints of
! AJWT's CCMC papers gratefully acknowledged.  The following comments are some
! useful implementation notes that fill in some technical details not (yet)
! explicitly described in the CCMC papers.

! CCMC
! ====
!
! In the following, a capital index refers to combined index (ie a single label
! for a determinant or excitor) and a lower case index referis to a spin
! orbital.  Hence |D_I> can be equivalently represented as |D_{ij...}^{ab..}.
!
! Analogue with FCIQMC
! --------------------
!
! In FCIQMC we essentially use first-order finite-difference approximation to the
! imaginary-time Schroedinger equation::
!
!     c_I(t+dt) = c_I(t) - < D_I | H - S | \Psi(t) > dt  (1)
!
! where::
!
!     \Psi(t) = \sum_J c_J(t) | D_J >.  (2)
!
! CCMC involves propogating a very similar equation::
!
!     < D_I | a_I D_0 > t_I(t+dt) = < D_I | a_I D_0 > t_I(t) - < D_I | H - S | \Psi_{CC}(t) > dt  (3)
!
! where::
!
!     \Psi_{CC}(t) = e^{T(t)} | D_0 >,  (4)
!
! and the cluster operator, T, is::
!
!     T(t) = \sum_{ia} t_i^a(t) a_i^a + 1/2!^2 \sum_{ijab} t_{ij}^{ab}(t) a_{ij}^{ab} + ...  (5)
!
! (I apologise for using a in two different senses...)
!
! The operators, {a_I=a_{ij...}^{ab...}}, known as excitors, cause electrons to
! be excited from occupied orbitals in the reference determinant to virtual
! orbitals and have corresponding amplitudes, {t_I}, which evolve in time.  In
! the infinite-time limit, the amplitudes converge onto the true CC
! wavefunction.
!
! Note that, depending upon the definition of a_I, < D_I | a_I D_0 > can be
! either +1 or -1.  Alex Thom defines a_I such that this term is always +1 in his
! CCMC papers but this definition is not convenient for computation.  See
! comments in collapse_cluster and convert_excitor_to_determinant.
!
! We can only handle uniquely defined excitors, i.e. we consider t_{ij}^{ab},
! t_{ji}^{ba}, t_{ji}^{ab} and t_{ij}^{ba} to be one entity.  This is fine as
! t_{ij}^{ab} a_{ij}^{ab} = t_{ji}^{ba} a_{ji}^{ba} = -t_{ji}^{ab} = -t_{ij}^{ba}.
! As a consequence, we must be very careful with the above expansion in (5).  We
! can simplify (5) such that each unique cluster only occurs once::
!
!     T(t) = \sum_{ia} t_i^a(t) a_i^a + \sum_{i<j,a<b} t_{ij}^{ab}(t) a_{ij}^{ab} + ...  (6)
!
! Evaluating e^{T(t)} is, as in traditional CC, performed using a series
! expansion::
!
!     e^{T(t)} = e^{\sum_I t_I a_I}                                           (7)
!              = 1 + sum_I t_I a_I + 1/2! sum_{IJ} t_I t_J a_I a_J + ...      (8)
!
! Alternatively, as pointed out by Trygve Helgaker, one can consider::
!
!     e^{T(t)} = e^{t_I(t) a_I} e^{t_J(t) a_J} e^{t_K(t) a_K} ...             (9)
!              = (1+t_I(t) a_I) (1+t_J(t) a_J) (1+t_K(t) a_K) ...             (10)
!
! which expands out to (8), except for the absence of the factorial prefactors,
! and uses the property that a_I a_I = 0.  However, there is no computational
! advantage to using this and, due to the need to consider an order for {I}, it
! is actually trickier to code than using (8).
!
! Normalisation
! -------------
!
! The convention that the overlap with the reference is set to unity is rather
! hard to maintain in CCMC.  Instead we follow the prescription of Alex Thom and
! introduce an additional variable, N_0, to act as a normalisation constant::
!
!     |\Psi_{CC}> = N_0 e^{T/N_0} | D_0 >    (11)
!
! The number of particles on the reference (not strictly excips though we shall
! refer to them by this name for the sake of conciseness and generality) is
! hence N_0 and can be varied stochastically to maintain the required
! (relative) normalisation.
!
! Dynamics
! --------
!
! Dynamics in FCIQMC involve stochastically sampling the action of the
! Hamiltonian.  As the projection onto the CC wavefunction in (3) involves many
! terms (higher-order 'clusters' of excitors), CCMC also requires one to
! stochastically sample the CC wavefunction itself.  This results in a process
! similar (but more complicated) than the FCIQMC dynamics.  The similarities are
! such that we can reuse much of the FCIQMC routines, including the excitation
! generators and annihilation procedures.
!
! The CC wavefunction can be sampled by selected a random cluster of excitors.
! Applying this cluster to the reference determinant generates a determinant,
! D_I.  The action of the Hamiltonian is sampled in an identical fashion to
! FCIQMC:
!
! #. Generate D_J, a random (single or double) excitation of D_I.  Create a new
!    particle on D_J with a probability proportional to |H_{IJ}| dt.
! #. Create a particle on D_I with a probability proportional to |H_{II}-S| dt.
!
! As with FCIQMC, because we do not allow every possible event to take place each
! iteration, the probabilities must be weighted accordingly by the probability
! that the event was selected.
!
! After we have sampled the CC wavefunction and sampled its evolution the desired
! number of times, we then annihilate all particles (excips) on the same excitor
! with opposite signs.
!
! There are two main differences between FCIQMC and CCMC evolution.  As the FCI
! wavefunction is a linear combination of determinants, we can simply loop over
! all particles (psips) on the determinants and allow them to spawn and die.  As
! the CC wavefunction ansatz involves an exponentiation, we must consider
! combinations of excitors and hence combinations of excips.  The stochastic
! sampling of the wavefunction is achieved by selecting random clusters;
! hopefully the comments in select_cluster provide suitable illumination.
!
! The other main difference (and certainly the hardest to get right) is that the
! signs of the excips and their progeny are *far* more subtle and involved than
! in FCIQMC.  In addition to the explicit minus sign in the propogation equation
! (3), the other sources of sign changes are:
!
! #. the sign of the excip from which a new excip is spawned/cloned/killed (also
!    in FCIQMC).  Note that the amplitude of the excips on a cluster of excitors
!    is the product of the amplitudes of the excips on the individual excitors.
! #. the sign of the Hamiltonian matrix element (also in FCIQMC).
! #. combining excitors to form a 'cluster' excitor requires reordering of the
!    set of annihilation and creation operators.  Each permutation causes a sign
!    change and thus an overall odd number of permutations causes a sign change
!    in the excip population.  See collapse_cluster.
! #. Applying the I-th excitor to D_0 can result in a sign change due to the
!    different definitions of an excitor and determinant which also requires
!    permutations of creation and annihilation operators.  See
!    convert_excitor_to_determinant.
! #. As we are creating an excip on the J-th excitor from the I-th excitor, we
!    must be consistent with our definition of the excitor; in particular they
!    might produce determinants of different signs when applied to the reference
!    determinant.  Thus if we consider creating an excip on t_J from t_I (where
!    J can be I or any connected excitor), we *must* take into account the signs
!    of the excitors relative to the reference determinant.
!
! In order for the correct dynamics to be performed, we must carefully
! accumulate all negative signs and take them into account when
! determining the sign of the child excips.
!
! Shift
! -----
!
! The shift is a free parameter introduced to provide control of the total population.
! The value of the shift should not affect the convergence of the wavefunction, only
! the overall growth.  Once the distribution of excips is (on average) correctly
! representing the wavefunction, this should remain true, regardless of the shift.
! But consider applying equation (3) above to the exact wavefunction.  The change in
! population from one iteration to the next is given by:
!
!   \Delta t_I = - dt < D_I | H - S | \Psi_{CC}(t) >                        (12)
!              = - dt (E_{CC} - S) < D_I | \Psi_{CC}(t) >
!
! This is not, in general, proportional to t_I, unless S = E_{CC}, so the amplitudes
! are not uniformly scaled and the new wavefunction is incorrect.  This can be
! remedied by instead using:
!
!   \Delta t_I = - dt < D_I | H - E | \Psi_{CC}(t) > - dt (E - S) t_I.      (13)
!
! As the exact energy E_{CC} is not known during the calculation, we use the projected
! energy estimator.  Once the shift has converged to E_{CC} (within stochastic
! fluctuations), the equations (3) and (13) are equivalent and either may be used.
!
! This new expression can be thought of as separating the two roles of the dynamics:
! the first term optimises the amplitudes to solve the coupled cluster equations,
! and the second provides control of the total population.
!
! Two sorts of clusters may be distinguished: composite clusters, that contain a product
! of two or more excitors, and non-composite that have only one or no excitors.  There is
! no difference in the dynamics of non-composite clusters between the use of equations (3)
! and (13), but on non-composite clusters the projected energy rather than the shift is
! used for the diagonal death step.  Death on the composite clusters does not necessarily
! remove particles, as all the population resides on non-composite clusters, but
! potentially increases the population on a (possibly previously unoccupied) excitor, so
! is not effective for population control. From this perspective it makes sense to not
! have the shift involved in such steps.
!
! Linked CCMC
! ===========
!
! Instead of sampling the amplitude equations (13), the equivalent equations::
!
!   t_I(t+dt) = t_I(t) - dt (< D_I | e^{-T(t)} (H - E) e^{T(t)} | D_0 > - (E - S) t_I(t))  (14)
!
! may be used. Using the identity::
!
!   e^T H e^{-T} = H + [H,T]_c + 1/2 [[H,T],T]_c + 1/3! [[[H,T],T],T]_c + 1/4! [[[[H,T],T],T],T]_c,  (15)
!
! where the subscript c indicates that only terms in the commutators coming from
! linked diagrams need to be included, gives a very similar form to the original
! equations. These equations, however, only include terms of at most fourth order
! in T regardless of the truncation level. The equations (14) can be sampled in
! very much the same way as (13), but require some modifications due to the
! presence of the commutators instead of a simple product of operators:
!
! #. Clusters that include two excitors that excite from (to) the same orbital
!    give a contribution to the equations, in contrast to the original form
!    where they do not as the product of the excitors is 0. This corresponds to
!    one excitor coming from the e^T and the other from the e^{-T} in (14). See
!    comments in select_cluster and linked_spawner_ccmc for details.
! #. Excitations not linked to the cluster being spawned from can be rejected.
!    See linked_excitation.
! #. Matrix elements used for spawning and death probabilities can have more than
!    one term from the commutator contributing. See stochastic_ccmc_death and
!    unlinked_commutator.
!
! Clusters
! ========
!
! We use clusters in two slightly different but related senses.  In both cases the cluster
! contains a set of excitors in a specific order.  The difference really only arises when we
! come to evaluate them.
!
! unlinked CC
!   A cluster is the product of the excitors and arises from sampling (8).
! linked CC
!   A cluster is the set of excitors and arises from sampling (15).  As the selected set
!   of excitors arise from the sampling of a sum of commutators, we must evaluate the
!   commutator by considering all possible partitions, where a partition is a defined by
!   a subset of excitors before the Hamiltonian and the remaining subset after the
!   Hamiltonian.  As a concrete example, the cluster {t_i, t_j} has partitions H t_i t_j,
!   t_i H t_j, t_j H t_i and t_j t_i H (with appropriate signs).
!
!   Helpfully, we also refer to the product of excitors either side of the Hamiltonian as
!   clusters in procedures which act upon products (ie in the same sense as unlinked CC)
!   but do not require (subsequent) application of the Hamiltonian.
!
! Note that we cannot separate the sampling the action of the Hamiltonian and the sampling
! of the wavefunction in linked CC in the same way that we can in unlinked CC.
