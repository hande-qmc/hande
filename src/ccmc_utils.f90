        ! We usually consider an excitor as a bit string representation of the
        ! determinant formed by applying the excitor (a group of annihilation
        ! and creation operators) to the reference determinant; indeed the
        ! determinant form is required when constructing Hamiltonian matrix
        ! elements.  However, the resulting determinant might actually contain
        ! a sign change, which needs to be absorbed into the (signed) population
        ! of excips on the excitor.

        ! This results from the fact that a determinant, |D>, is defined as:
        !   |D> = a^+_i a^+_j ... a^+_k |0>,
        ! where |0> is the vacuum, a^+_i creates an electron in the i-th
        ! orbital, i<j<...<k and |0> is the vacuum.  An excitor is defined as
        !   t_{ij...k}^{ab...c} = a^+_a a^+_b ... a^+_c a_k ... a_j a_i
        ! where i<j<...<k and a<b<...<c.  (This definition is somewhat
        ! arbitrary; the key thing is to be consistent.)  Hence applying an
        ! excitor to the reference might result in a change of sign, i.e.
        ! t_{ij}^{ab} |D_0> = -|D_{ij}^{ab}>.  As a more concrete example,
        ! consider a set of spin states (as the extension to fermions is
        ! irrelevant to the argument), with the reference:
        !   |D_0> = | 1 2 3 >
        ! and the excitor
        !   t_{13}^{58}
        ! Thus, using |0> to denote the vacuum:
