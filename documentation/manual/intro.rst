Introduction
============

HANDE contains optimised, highly parallel implementations of the full configuration
interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) [Booth09]_, coupled cluster
Monte Carlo (CCMC) [Thom10]_ and Density Matrix Quantum Monte Carlo (DMQMC) 
[Blunt14]_, [Malone15]_ algorithms for a variety of systems.  Development
work continues to add new features and investigate the algorithms and new applications.

HANDE can perform calculations on generic systems such as molecules via an externally
generated integral file. The integral file is in the FCIDUMP format
[Knowles89]_, which can be generated by several quantum chemistry codes such as
MOLPRO, Q-Chem (with patches from Alex Thom) and PSI4.
HANDE can also perform calculations on model Hamiltonians, for which no
additional integrals are required.  The model Hamiltonians currently available are the
Hubbard model, Heisenberg model and uniform electron gas.

Configuration interaction (CI) is also implemented using external libraries
(lapack/scalapack and TRLan respectively) and can be performed in both serial and
parallel.  Lanczos diagonalisation can also be performed with or without precomputing the
Hamiltonian matrix.  Note that this is rather slow and intended for debugging purposes
only.  Most quantum chemistry codes (e.g. PSI4) contain a substantially more powerful and
optimised CI implementation.
