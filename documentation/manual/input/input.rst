Input file
==========

HANDE is controlled via an input file which is a simple lua script.  This has the
advantage of creating a clean, simple interface to HANDE whilst allowing advanced users to
perform complex simulations without requiring parsing complicated (and perhaps bespoke)
logic in a custom input parser.  Future work will include exposing more of HANDE via
the lua API, thus increasing the flexibility available.

Running a simulation typically involves creating a quantum system (i.e. a collection of
spins/fermions/etc acting under a specified Hamiltonian) and then performing one or more
calculations on that system.  Both tasks involve calling functions from the input file.

The following sections detail options available in each system and calculation
function.  Variables can be required (i.e. must be specified if a function is called) or
optional (in which case the default is stated).  The type (e.g. float, such as 1.234;
integer, such as 1; boolean, either ``true`` or ``false``) of each variable is also given.

Systems
^^^^^^^

All functions which create a system return a pointer to a :code:`system` object (which
currently cannot be manipulated or inspected from lua).  All calculation functions take
this variable as an argument.

Calculations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

All QMC methods (FCIQMC, CCMC, UCCMC, DMQMC and the simple FCIQMC implementation)
return a pointer to a :code:`qmc_state` object (which cannot be directly manipulated or
inspected from lua) as the first return value.  They also accept such an object as an
optional argument to resume a previous QMC calculation.  Additional,
calculation-specific, values are returned in some cases, as described in the relevant
section.
