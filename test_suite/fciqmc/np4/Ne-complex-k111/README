The fcidumpfile and fcidumpfile_X were generated using pyscf with the pyscfdump scripts.

The generation of these was by scripts in the integral_generation subfolder.
run.sh calls Ne_molcryst_new.py which uses pyscfdump and pyscf to generate and dump the integrals.

The output of Ne_molcryst_new.py is given in ne_111_k500.scf.out and runs through several cell parameters of
Ne crystal before reaching the one included which corresponds to a=19.5
