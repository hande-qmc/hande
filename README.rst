`HANDE <http://www.hande.org.uk>`_ is an efficient, highly parallel code for stochastic quantum chemistry.  It can be
used both as a standalone program or (optionally) as a library from an existing quantum
chemistry code.  For a description of its main features see  `J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 3, 1728-1742 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01217>`_.
